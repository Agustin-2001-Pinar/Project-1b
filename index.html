        <p>Agustin is a 21-year-old New Orleans based guitarist originally from Uruguay. He started his journey on guitar at the age of nine and has played with several bands from his homeland and the US, acquiring experience in live performances, music composition and studio recording.</p>

            <p>His passion for guitar began during his childhood when listening to 60s-80s rock/pop music. His skills were developed under influences of blues, rock, funk and jazz.</p>
            
            <p>One of the highlights in his story was the decision to study music in the US, which allowed him to interact with musicians on a daily basis. He is currently a student at Loyola University New Orleans where he not only collaborates with several artists and studies with local musicians, but also enriched his skills by being exposed to new music every day, changing his perspective on guitar playing and challenging him to pursuit new sounds and styles.</p>
            
            <p>At this point Agustin has played in bands ranging styles from funk, pop and jazz to latin and rap music. He is regularly called to record and compose and has played in many famous New Orleans venues such as Tipitina's and The Howlin' Wolf. Some artists he works with include Mynthia "The Icon", Pablo Amat, Lyle Hutchins and Isabella Cabal.</p>
